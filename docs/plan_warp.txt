Plan
- exit gate
- enemy units
- firing
- end turn
- enemy ai
- gate model
- forests, other decals
- better terrain generation
- smoother unit movement (start rotating to the next tile, before reaching previous one)

* Landscape
- different types of terrain
- geometry on the edges depends on the 2 neighbouring tiles


* Move between planets
- next planet

* More tiles
- truncated icosahedron sphere tiling

* UI
- Global drag to panel drag

* Beautify
- sun lens flare and bloom


done
+ animated unit movement
+ unit model
+ available tiles highlight
+ player controlled unit
+ enter gates
+ hills, mountains
