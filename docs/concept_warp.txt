Warp

The player commands a land-based mothership on a journey from destroyed homeplanet to the center of the galaxy. 
The player visits several star systems along the way.
In each star system the player moves from the outer planet to the ones closer to the star.
Each planet has an enter/exit gates. The final planet in a system has an interstellar gate and a "boss" battle.
Player can retreat through an enter gate and choose another path or retry a planet. But at the cost of losing time.
Some planets have the gates combined. Those are usually pure reward planets, for a chance to gather more resources for the journey.
The stars are being drained by the invaders. Over time the planets get colder and are eventually captured, starting from the outer ones. 
Visiting a captured planet makes the ship suffer damage over time.

Alternatively:
Bigger individual maps with iconic locations (still rendomly generated). Zoltan homeworlds, Golden Bay, Iceland etc.

Inspirations:
Into the Breach (the board, destructable terrain, natural disasters, roguelike, unit's abilities) 
FTL (roguelike, wave-like pacing, finding items, scrap, blueprints)
Homeworld and Desert of Kharak (mothership, building units, journey to a new home from destroyed home-planet)
Civilization (tactical combat on a grid)
Might and Magic (journey through different lands, different people)
Heroes (structures provide bonuses, exploring maps)
Total Annihilation (Tanks, Artillery, Air units)
X-COM (tactical combat)

- warp tunels are huge antennas pointing to the sky. Upon entering a tunnel camera rises up.
- air units can be deployed at a tile and then move once before retreating. Air unit can ether move or shoot at a tile.
