THE NEW STORY
You are on a desert planet called Lode.
People of Lode didn't discover interstellar travel yet.
The people of Lode were found by the Ancients and prepared for the Ascention.
The Acention is the process of integrating a new race into the Gallactic Communities of Life. 
They get the latest interstellar tech, and all the knowledge on the ways of Life.
The Ancients brought a spaceship and directions on how to get to it. It's called an Ark.
The Ancients are gone from the Galaxy, nowhere to be found.
The spaceship was captured by the powerful modern alien race, called Rok.
The Rok were once ascended by the Ancients.
They spill propaganda to exploit the people of Lode. They actively prevent them from getting to space.
They're the gods for most people of Lode, the most fanatical followers are the government of Lode.
Some people, however, discovered the directions of the Ancients.
They built the Phase Drive, which allows them to teleport throughout the planet and from a certain point -- to the spaceship.

Warp

The player commands a land-based mothership on a journey from destroyed homeplanet to the center of the galaxy. 
The player visits several star systems along the way.
In each star system the player moves from the outer planet to the ones closer to the star.
Each planet has an enter/exit gates. The final planet in a system has an interstellar gate and a "boss" battle.
Player can retreat through an enter gate and choose another path or retry a planet. But at the cost of losing time.
Some planets have the gates combined. Those are usually pure reward planets, for a chance to gather more resources for the journey.
The stars are being drained by the invaders. Over time the planets get colder and are eventually captured, starting from the outer ones. 
Visiting a captured planet makes the ship suffer damage over time.

Alternatively:
Bigger individual maps with iconic locations (still half-rendomly generated). Homeworlds, Golden Bay, Iceland etc.

Inspirations:
Into the Breach (the board, destructable terrain, natural disasters, roguelike, unit's abilities) 
FTL (roguelike, wave-like pacing, finding items, scrap, blueprints)
Civilization (tactical combat on a grid)
Homeworld and Desert of Kharak (mothership, building units, journey to a new home from destroyed home-planet)
Might and Magic (journey through different lands, different people)
Heroes (structures provide bonuses, exploring maps)
Total Annihilation (Tanks, Artillery, Air units)
X-COM (tactical combat)

Ideas
- time beacons, places on the planet where the phase drive can jump to.
- Laputa/Zelda architecture, rising towers
- Emotional modifiers: shocked, angry, etc.
- the player is treated as an advanced AI, built with Ancients tech. Can travel back in time (permadeath). Adviser/Predictor. Later it's revealed that the tech is a relay for gamers of the past.
- tesla tree
- underground tree world
- the planet is a desert, because it's easier to gather resources this way. It was earthlike a long time ago
- there is a relationship between phaseship's women-pilot and one of the vehicle pilots. If the pilot dies the women pilot gets a permanent debuff (which is worse at the beginnning, then becomes positive and negative)
- the player was allowed to travel through the gates to become the administrator of the galaxy
- the first stage of invasion was to cut off all interstellar gates
- the enemy is enslaving the civilizations
- two phases of evil invasion for each planet (in progress/finished)
- each civ has guaranteed vendors/quests/tech etc.
- boost speed
- traders
- cities
- destructable mountains - can produce volcano by chance
- trojan unit (heavy armor transport with a blinker)
- blinker (short teleporter)
- mini-transporters (instantly move all resources to the mothership) 
- unit blueprints
- weapon blueprints
- destroy structures
- teleporter
- warp tunels are huge antennas pointing to the sky. Upon entering a tunnel camera rises up.
- air units can be deployed at a tile and then move once before retreating. Air unit can ether move or shoot at a tile.
- shooting over a mountain: target receives a defence bonus
- heat adds a cooldown penalty (+1 turn cd, but doesn't stack): burning forests, desert, volcanic
- stealth
- a tile can be sinked by an explosion or a strong weapon
- earthquake weapon -- shock wave in a circle
- laser weapons shoot in a line
