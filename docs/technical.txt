- generalize actions
  - unit.actions
  - unit.current_actions (maybe evaluate in the user to avoid allocation)
  - can_be_performed_in_general (just shouldn't be in the unit in the first place)
  - can_be_performed_now
  - perform
  - differentiate by possible target type: a unit, a structure or both.
  - current actions: move, interact, fire (1, 2, 3...), deploy a unit (1, 2, 3...), dock
  - regular actions: move, interact
  - player.is_special_action_selected

- turn Selection into a class
- prefab can be referenced by a script
- rename Unit to CUnit (as in component)

done:
- cache transform
- custom non allocating linq
- generalize dock, undock and move (move to location)
- location.is_accessible_by(the_unit)
- if location is a bay, it returns a tile of the parent? => made a separate method the_tile
